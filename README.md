Project 2 | Part 1 - UX Research & Wireframes

1. Choose an Existing Subject:
Which idea?
Improving exercise 1 (tip screen)
2. Conduct user experience research, for example:
Learnings from the interviews (1-5 people)
-Like the liberty of the slider
-Like the incorporation of a subtotal and a total
-Possibly add a title
	Make it warm and not like “TIP ME”
	Warmer colors and / or a smiley face will add to the genuineness of the interaction
-“People are lazy and won’t press next”
“Complete transaction”
-”People are very visual, if you make a little nice message and some brighter colors it will encourage people to interact with it”


Learnings from in class presentation
-Finger might be in the way of the dollar amount on the bottom
-Color pallet is random
-Make it usable for a company!


3. Create Wireframes:
Sketch an early wireframe (preferably on paper or Figma) to address the learnings.
Annotate wireframes with details (labels, interactions, animation, etc.).
